    "For our project, we will be analyzing a [dataset](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/blob/master/Artworks.csv) concerning the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). In late 2019, MoMA underwent [renovations](https://time.com/5688507/moma-reopening/) and reorganization of its galleries to feature more recent contemporary artists and global art. Our overarching question is exploring whether or not MoMA fulfilled its goal of expanding the diversity of its art collection. In order to see if this shift was reflected in their collection and acquisitions, we will attempt to measure the overall diversity a work adds to the collection by analyzing the relevant aspects of the artwork such as the artist's nationality, the artist’s gender, the year the work was created, the year it was acquired, and various other factors. Although it is impossible to truly quantify the abstract concept of diversity, we believe that analyzing overall patterns in acquisitions will be helpful in determining whether or not MoMA has been successful in its goal of introducing new viewpoints to its collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we will answer questions such as: is there an overwhelming number of male artists represented?; has MoMA recently been acquiring artwork from non-American at a higher frequency than in the past?; is the artwork acquired from non-American artists from Western European countries or elsewhere?; how does the average age of a work of art change in different time periods. By answering all of these smaller questions, we will be able to make a judgement on our overall  research question of assessing the diversity of the collection in recent years. We will also look at the trends over time to see if there are changes in what kind of artwork MoMA typically collects and note any differences between time periods. We have found a rich and detailed dataset with 138,219 works of art owned by MoMA acquired from 1929 to June of 2020, so we will have a lot of information pertaining to the type of artwork MoMA has acquired in different time periods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the thorough analysis we will conduct on MoMA dataset, we also plan to compare the MoMA’s collection to other large modern/contemporary art museums like the [Tate](https://github.com/tategallery/collection), a modern art museum in London. Through a comparison of the Tate and the MoMA we will be able to see if there are any differences in collections and trends between museums in two different countries. We will also investigate the collection of the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), another famous art museum in New York City. Even though the Met is not specifically focused on modern art, we will be able to key into its modern/contemporary art collection and only focus specifically on those works. By comparing the MoMA to these other museums we will be able to see if they not only reached their goals but if their goals place them as a forward thinker on modern art and not just a part of the crowd. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of collaboration, we have set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lindsayhardy17/lindsayhardy17.github.io)and plan for storing the datasets, sharing code, and version control. We plan to meet on Zoom once a week on Tuesdays at 3:10, right after class, and will also be flexible with adding a second time to meet on Thursday after class as well.  During these meetings we plan to check our progress, solve problems, and ask questions, in addition to communicating outside of scheduled meetings as needed.\n",
